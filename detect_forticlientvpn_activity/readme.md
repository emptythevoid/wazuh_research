A basic example of using FIM to detect changes in the settings.dat file of the Forticlient VPN to see if the client is being actively used or not. 
This is *not* for logging actual usage information. It's only to give a general idea of which endpoints are actively using
Forticlient VPN connections over time.

Note: Using the settings.dat file as an indicator of *active* VPN usage is not 100% accurate. This should be used as an approximate indicator only.
